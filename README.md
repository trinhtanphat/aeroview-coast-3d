# AEROVIEW — Coastal Metropolis 🌊

A polished, immersive 3D city demo inspired by coastal aerial flyover visuals. Powered by **Three.js**, **Vite**, and procedural real-time geometry. No paid APIs, Google tiles, external map data, logins, or secrets.

## Features

- 🌇 Procedural coastal city with **thousands of buildings and animated water**
- 🎬 Cinematic auto-flyover plus free orbit, pan and zoom
- ☀️ Dawn / Day / Sunset / Night and volumetric-look atmospheric haze
- 🏙️ Camera presets: Skyline, Top Down, Coastline, Street
- ✨ Window lighting, palms, tidal waterways, boats, cloud layers
- 📱 Responsive UI with accessible interactive controls
- 🔐 No third-party map data or API key; all geometry generated in the browser

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5188](http://localhost:5188) (default Vite binds on 0.0.0.0; for local-only run `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1`).

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:browser  # Optional Chrome automation on Windows 181
```

## Publish on GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build:pages
```

Serve the repo's `/docs` directory from the `main` branch in GitHub Pages. The built asset base is `/aeroview-coast-3d/`. The deployment has no GitHub Actions workflow file by design.

## Performance notes

Three.js requires WebGL. On GPU-backed computers and mobile devices, performance depends on GPU. On WIN11-181, the desktop session reports **Microsoft Remote/Basic Display Adapter** (no confirmed hardware GPU), and the Chrome headless software renderer measured **~3 FPS** at 1440×900 while a typical GPU-backed client may be much faster. The 3D scene is original and illustrative — **not** a reconstruction of a real city or the original Facebook video's full assets.
